            Within this organization, there exists a council no one ever mentions.
            They are known simply as <span className="text-[#fead53]">The High Table</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            They do not speak. They do not show themselves. They do not vote.
            They decide.

          <p>
            While the world sees the faces of leadership, the real power moves quietly behind the scenes.
            The current leaders? They are merely puppets—strings pulled by unseen hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rumors say members of The High Table sometimes step down from their seats, moving among the ranks
            as ordinary leaders and members. You might work alongside one without ever knowing.

            If you’ve found this hidden page, you’ve stepped into a shadow few ever glimpse, and even fewer understand.
            Only a handful—the worthy—have ever made it this far.
          </p>
          <p>
            Behind it lies a vault that accepts only a handful of names.
            Never many, never few—just enough to test the worthy.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a test of endurance and wit. Survival of the fittest.
            Survival of the bravest. Survival of the smartest.
          </p>
          <p>
            But beware: working in groups can tip the scales.
            More eyes mean more chances—but less secrecy.
            The more who know, the faster the shadows will shift, and the slimmer your odds of being chosen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only those who endure will earn the notice of The High Table.
            If you are truly worthy, you will not need to seek them.
            <span className="text-[#fead53]">They will find you.</span>
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="mt-10 text-sm text-gray-500 italic">
          ⚠️ If this secret ever leaks beyond this place, The High Table will retreat into the shadows forever.
